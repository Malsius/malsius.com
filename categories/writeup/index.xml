      <description>Subject Flag is typed !
Challenge analysis The file provided with this challenge is a packet capture file (.pcap).
So we open it with Wireshark.
We can see that the captured packetsâ€™s protocol is USB.
From the title and the subject of the challenge, and the fact that we have to find a flag, we can assume that this capture is from a QWERTY keyboard.
First we have to extract the captured data to be able to process them in an automated way.</description>
